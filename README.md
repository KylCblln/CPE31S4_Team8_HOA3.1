Procedure
1. Create a github repository here: https://github.com/KylCblln/CPE31S4 Team8 HOA3.1/tree/main/roles.

2. In the group's directory, we made an inventory of the machines' IP addresses.

3.0 The group established a new directory called "Roles."

4. The group was able to construct roles for each service within the newly created roles directory.

5. The main.yml file in the tasks directory was used to install both Ubuntu and CentOS.

6. We created config.yml in the Roles directory, which calls the roles of each service.

7. Upon the installations, we verified that the following codes were operational by running the command ansible-playbook.

8. Finally, the following configuration was committed and pushed to the recently established repository within the git hub.
